# Escalating support cases
{: #escalation}

You can use the escalation process to surface critical issues and voice your concern if a support ticket isn't being addressed appropriately. When a case is escalated, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support team reviews the information in the support case and responds with appropriate updates. For information about case severity, see [Case severity and initial response times](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-support-case-severity).

To escalate a case, complete the following steps:

1. Contact {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support by phone or chat:
  * By phone at +1-(866)403-7638.
  * By chat from the [Support Center](https://{DomainName}/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.
1. Provide your existing case number and request to escalate the case.
1. Provide the justification for escalation and the business impact of your problem or issue.

If your support inquiry requires a more immediate response, consider upgrading to the premium or advanced support plan so that you can open severity 1-4 support cases. To upgrade your support plan, contact your [IBM sales representative](https://www.ibm.com/contact/us/en/?lnk=flg-cont-usen){: external}.
