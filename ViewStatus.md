# Viewing cloud status
{: #viewing-cloud-status}

The Status page is the central place to find details about all incidents, planned maintenance, announcements, and security bulletins about key events that affect the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} platform and services.
{:shortdesc}

To get notified about key events that are specifically affecting your account, go to the [Notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/user/notifications) page. You can easily update your preferences there.

2. Click **View cloud status**.
3. You can view all ongoing events, including confirmed incidents and those that are under investigation, and the status of all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resources. Expand a resource's row to view more details. 
4. From the side navigation pane, you can select to view planned maintenance, security bulletins, announcements, and history.
    * Click **Planned maintenance** to see any upcoming maintenance that's scheduled. 
    * Click **Security bulletins** to view a list of security bulletins that might affect various {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services or the platform.

  {: tip}

## Subscribing to an RSS feed
{: #subscribing-rss-feed}

You can stay up-to-date about the events by subscribing to the RSS feed for the Status page. Ongoing incidents or planned maintenance windows that impact a finite set of accounts do not display on the Status page.

1. Use your reader to subscribe to the feed with one of the following methods:
    * Drag the RSS icon ![RSS-24px](../icons/RSS-24px.svg) into your RSS reader.
    * Right-click the RSS icon, select **Copy link address**, and paste the URL into your RSS reader.
